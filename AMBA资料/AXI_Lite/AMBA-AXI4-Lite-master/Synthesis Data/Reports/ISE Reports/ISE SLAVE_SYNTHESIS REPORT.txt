                WARNING:Xst:646 - Signal <ARADDR_reg<31:4>> is assigned but never used. This unconnected signal will be trimmed during the optimization process.
                INFO:Xst:2117 - HDL ADVISOR - Mux Selector <WState_S> of Case statement line 111 was re-encoded using one-hot encoding. The case statement will be optimized (default statement optimization), but this optimization may lead to design initialization problems. To ensure the design works safely, you can:
                   	- add an 'INIT' attribute on signal <WState_S> (optimization is then done without any risk)
                   	- use the attribute 'signal_encoding user' to avoid onehot optimization
                   	- use the attribute 'safe_implementation yes' to force XST to perform a safe (but less efficient) optimization
